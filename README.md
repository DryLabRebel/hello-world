# hello-world

> The obligatory hello world repo.

My name is *Geoff English*.

I'm a PhD student studying the genetics and heritability of ADHD.

I'm a beginner in statistics, R, python, bash and fatherhood. I'm a Vim fan (because when you're a vim user, people need to know).

Planning on using this account for:

- writing and maintaining a Vim colour scheme or two
- keeping a copy of my .vimrc
- work and data related scripts
- anything else I feel it would be useful for

I have a blog:

and a caffiene addiction.

I love listening to chiptune and cyberpunk while I work because it's important to know that too.
