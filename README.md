# hello-world

> The obligatory hello world repo.

My name is *Geoff English*.

I'm a PhD student studying the genetics and heritability of ADHD.

I'm a beginner statistician, R and python programmer and command line user. Vim fan.

Planning on using this account for:

- writing and maintain a Vim colour scheme or two
- keeping a copy of my .vimrc
- anything else I feel it would be useful for

I have a blog:
