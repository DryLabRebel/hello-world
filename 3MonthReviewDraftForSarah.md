Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, persistent, highly comorbid symptom profile with many underlying causes both within and between individuals. ADHD is present in ~5-12% of children with ~50% persistence into adulthood (10 references here)

ADHD is characterized by a persistent pattern of innatention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity in a variety of symptom areas. Further, these symptoms must negatively affect at least two major life areas (school, home, social engagements) such that it impedes age appropriate development or normal functioning (DSM5).

Despite various name changes ADHD has been identified and characterized in some form or another as early the 18th Century. Sir Alexander Chricton in 1798 published his three volume works on mental illness wherein volume two describes a condition which is, arguably, consistent with what is today termed ADHD.

He states:

"The incapacity of attending with a necessary degree of constancy to any one object" (as quoted Lange et al, 2010, pp242)

[//]: # ( Is this even relevant/necessary? )

Of the three ADHD subtypes described in the DSM-V today, the symptom profile for each is described in Table X (Insert table).

Twin studies have consistently estimated the heritability of ADHD at approximately 60-90%. Suggesting that genetic effects play an important role in ADHD variation in the population.

Twin studies estimate heritability by way of a simple linear regression which plots the average difference between MZ and DZ twins for a given trait and takes 2x the correlation of these differences as the varaince explained by genetic effects.

Modern genetic studies are beginning to uncover Genome-Wide associated variants currently at no less than ~ 12 GWAS hits having reached the stringent threshold.

[//]: # ( Cite some examples, explain some of the methods used, when was the first hit documented? Explain that paper a bit )

Despite the high prevalence and high estimated heritability mining for Genome wide significant variants has been difficult while other psychiatric disorders have yeilded many more significant hits to date. For example ...

[//]: # ( Is this true?? - Did I hear a paper recently say the opposite? )

Some of the reasons for this difficulty in finding significant GWAS hits for ADHD include:

## insufficient sample sizes  ##

Modern GWAS methods perform a simple linear regression on all individual SNP markers using either Whole Genomes, or imputed haplotype reference panels and perform a simple comparison between cases and controls for the presence of a given SNP and thus when performing GWAS on a few hundred thousand SNP's require extremely stringent p-value thresholds in order to account for the massive multiple testing burdens (5 x 10^-8). The probabilty of false positives below this threshold is prohibitively high meaning that common variants of only small effect slip through the cracks.

Sufficiently large sample sizes are required to find associations which reach this stringent threshold.

## poor quality phenotype data (self report, rater effects, etc.)  ##

There is evidence that studies on Oppositional Defiant Disorder, a disorder commonly comorbid with ADHD has been shown to be strongly influenced by rater effects, and it has been suggested that ADHD is also susceptible, given that diagnoses is primarily on the basis of reporting (self, parent/caregiver, teacher).

[//]: # ( Learn and then explain how this affects GWAS significance and quality results in general )

## high polygenicity  ##

Highly polygenic traits are those which are influenced by multiple genes. In general, the more genes that contribute to a trait, the smaller the average
contribution of any one causal gene, the smaller the effect of causal genes (or the lack of LD with SNP markers) means that larger samples sizes are required in
order to successfully detect the association/effect of that gene/region.

## genetic heterogenity  ##

ADHD is characterised into three basic subtypes, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and combined innatention/hyperactivity. This makes it likely that a
number genes contribute to all three subtypes, and a number of genes further influence individual subtypes independently. This makes it more difficult to detect
significant associations given that samples will either have heterogenity problems, or sample sizes will be lower if split by sybtype.

[//]: # ( Look up heterogenity )

## environmental heterogenity  ##

The environmental effects that influence variation in ADHD also have an impact on the ability to detect associations, especially if they are unknown (?)

 symptoms which are caused by comorbidity with other conditions (insomnia for example) 

[//]: # ( Does this/How does this influence GWAS? )

Given that ADHD is a symptom profile, it may be causally related to other comorbid disorders, contributing to its environmental and genetic heterogeneity, this
will make it difficult to mine for SNP's that reach genome wide significance, given that the associations will actually be more patchy and heterogenous.

## Gene-Environment and Gene-Gene interactions - Upward bias _h2_ in twin studies  ##

Gene by environment and gene by gene interactions are known to influence the heritability of traits if not accounted for in the model as the models tend to
assume additive genetic and environmental effects. Gene-gene and gene by environment effects have been known to influence other psychiatric disorders such as 

[//]: # ( examples?? Depression/Schiz/Bip/ODD?? )

## Inflated _h2_ estimates (GxE, Shared environment, heterogenity, etc.)  ##

Traditional twin studies have been shown to produce inflated _h2_ estimates in other traits besides ADHD, such as BMI for example. Given there is evidence of 
some variability in the heritability estimated for ADHD by twin and family studies to date, It's possible that _h2_ for ADHD has been traditionally over
estimated also.

# Where to go from here, how to test this hypothesis #

What am I trying to do here? I'm trying to segue into what needs to be done to improve the heritability estimates for ADHD, and/or better mine for GWAS hits, in order to better understand the genetic architechure of this complex psychiatric trait.

Explain the need to move towards more collaboration, larger data sets, continuous rating scales, perhaps hypothesis free population wide case-only samples...
